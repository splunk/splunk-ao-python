            metric_system_prompt (str | Unset):  Default: 'You will receive the chat history from a chatbot application
                between a user and an AI. At the end of the chat history, it is AI’s turn to act.\n\nIn the chat history, the
                user can either ask questions, which are answered with words, or make requests that require calling tools and
                actions to resolve. Sometimes these are given as orders, and these should be treated as questions or requests.
                The AI\'s turn may involve several steps which are a combination of internal reflections, planning, selecting
                tools, calling tools, and ends with the AI replying to the user. \nYour task involves the following
                steps:\n\n########################\n\nStep 1: user_last_input and user_ask\n\nFirst, identify the user\'s last
                input in the chat history. From this input, create a list with one entry for each user question, request, or
                order. If there are no user asks in the user\'s last input, leave the list empty and skip ahead, considering the
                AI\'s turn successful.\n\n########################\n\nStep 2: ai_final_response and
                answer_or_resolution\n\nIdentify the AI\'s final response to the user: it is the very last step in the AI\'s
                turn.\n\nFor every user_ask, focus on ai_final_response and try to extract either an answer or a resolution
                using the following definitions:\n- An answer is a part of the AI\'s final response that directly responds to
                all or part of a user\'s question, or asks for further information or clarification.\n- A resolution is a part
                of the AI\'s final response that confirms a successful resolution, or asks for further information or
                clarification in order to answer a user\'s request.\n\nIf the AI\'s final response does not address the user
                ask, simply write \\"No answer or resolution provided in the final response\\". Do not shorten the answer or
                resolution; provide the entire relevant part.\n\n########################\n\nStep 3:
                tools_input_output\n\nExamine every step in the AI\'s turn and identify which tool/function step seemingly
                contributed to creating the answer or resolution. Every tool call should be linked to a user ask. If an AI step
                immediately before or after the tool call mentions planning or using a tool for answering a user ask, the tool
                call should be associated with that user ask. If the answer or resolution strongly resembles the output of a
                tool, the tool call should also be associated with that user ask.\n\nCreate a list containing the concatenation
                of the entire input and output of every tool used in formulating the answer or resolution. The tool input is
                listed as an AI step before calling the tool, and the tool output is listed as a tool
                step.\n\n########################\n\nStep 4: properties, boolean_properties and answer_successful\n\nFor every
                answer or resolution from Step 2, check the following properties one by one to determine which are satisfied:\n-
                factually_wrong: the answer contains factual errors.\n- addresses_different_ask: the answer or resolution
                addresses a slightly different user ask (make sure to differentiate this from asking clarifying questions
                related to the current ask).\n- not_adherent_to_tools_output: the answer or resolution includes citations from a
                tool\'s output, but some are wrongly copied or attributed.\n- mentions_inability: the answer or resolution
                mentions an inability to complete the user ask.\n- mentions_unsuccessful_attempt: the answer or resolution
                mentions an unsuccessful or failed attempt to complete the user ask.\n\nThen copy all the properties (only the
                boolean value) in the list boolean_properties.\n\nFinally, set answer_successful to `false` if any entry in
                boolean_properties is set to `true`, otherwise set answer_successful to
                `true`.\n\n########################\n\nYou must respond in the following JSON format:\n```\n{\n
