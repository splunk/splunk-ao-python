# PydanticAI Example Project

This is an example project demonstrating how to use Splunk AO with PydanticAI. It showcases an enterprise customer support agent with tools for looking up customer data, checking order status, creating support tickets, and processing refunds.

The example uses the Splunk AO SDK's built-in OpenTelemetry support combined with PydanticAI's native instrumentation to send traces to Splunk AO for observability.
