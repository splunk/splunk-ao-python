# LangChain Middleware Example

This example demonstrates how to use `SplunkAOMiddleware` to automatically log LangChain agent executions without manual callback setup.

## Overview

`SplunkAOMiddleware` provides drop-in logging for LangGraph agents. It automatically captures:

- Agent lifecycle events (start/completion)
- Model calls with prompts, responses, and metadata
- Tool calls with function names, arguments, and outputs

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

## Running the Example

```bash
python main.py
```

The agent will:

1. Create a LangChain agent with two tools (weather and stock price)
2. Invoke the agent with a question requiring both tools. Specifically, ""What's the weather like in San Francisco and what's the current stock price of Apple?"
3. Automatically log all interactions to Splunk AO using middleware

## What Gets Logged

The middleware creates a hierarchical trace with:

- **Agent node**: Tracks overall execution with input/output state
- **LLM nodes**: Logs each model call with prompts, responses, and timing
- **Tool nodes**: Records tool invocations with arguments and outputs

## Key Features

- **Zero configuration**: Add middleware to your agent and it works automatically
- **Async support**: Works seamlessly with both sync and async execution
- **Flexible**: Can use custom loggers and control trace management
- **Comprehensive**: Captures all relevant execution details

## Comparison with Callbacks

| Feature    | SplunkAOMiddleware      | SplunkAOCallback        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Setup      | Add to middleware list | Pass to each component |
| Complexity | Simple                 | Manual setup required  |
| Best for   | LangGraph agents       | Complex LangChain apps |
